# What is Git used for?

You obviously already know this, but just to establish:

- Git is a **version control system**, a tool used for **tracking changes** in computer files and coordinating work on those files **among multiple people**.

- It is **primarily used for source code management** in software development.

- Git allows multiple developers to **work together** on a project **without interfering** with each other's changes. It enables the **creation of different branches**, where new features or fixes can be developed separately from the main working codebase.

- Git also helps in maintaining a history of changes, so previous versions can be restored and it **facilitates merging different code versions**.
